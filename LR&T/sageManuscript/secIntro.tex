While designing lighting systems for indoor working places the designer must take into account several requirements, of which the main would be to provide enough light for the given purpose of the interior space at a reasonable power consumption. These and more requirements are set by the Czech national standards \cite{12464} mandatory on the territory of the Czech republic.

Within the framework of this project a test model room has been chosen of dimensions $5 \times 10 $~meters, $4$~meters high with luminaires $3.5$~metres above the floor. The model room's purpose was to provide for handwriting, writing on typewriters, reading and processing data according to reference number 5.26.2 in~\cite{12464}. There are several conditions required by the standard that have to be met by the lighting system:

\begin{description}
	\item[$\overline{E}_{m}$] Maintained Average Illuminance of 500 lux
	\item[$UGR_{L}$] Unified Glare Rating 19
	\item[$U_{0}$] Lighting Uniformity 0.6
	\item[$R_{a}$] General Color Rendering Index 80
\end{description}


To meet the requirements set by \cite{12464} for the model room, reference plane's average illuminance must be $\overline{E}_{m}$ or greater at all times over the course of operation. To calculate the initially needed illuminance values, the Maintenance Factor has to be calculated~\cite{CIE97}. For this instance, MF has been chosen to be~$0.75$. The reference plane is defined as a horizontal plane $75$~cm above the floor for generic office tables as suggested in~\cite{12464}. $UGR_{L}$ will not be included in calculations of this project, for the task area and view directions of users are unknown. $R_{a}$ is a parameter of light sources and luminaires and thus must not be incorporated into calculations.
