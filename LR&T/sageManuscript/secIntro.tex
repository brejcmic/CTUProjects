While designing lighting systems for indoor working places the designer must take into account several requirements, of which the main would be to provide enough light for the given purpose of the interior space at a reasonable power consumption. These and more requirements are set by the Czech national standards \cite{12464} mandatory on the territory of the Czech republic.

Within the framework of this project a test model room has been chosen of dimensions $5 \times 10 $~meters, $4$~meters high with luminaires $3.5$~metres above the floor. The model room's purpose was to provide for handwriting, writing on typewriters, reading and processing data according to reference number 5.26.2 in~\cite{12464}. There are several conditions required by the standard that have to be met by the lighting system:

%\begin{description}
%	\item[$\overline{E}_{m}$] Maintained Average Illuminance of 500 lux
%	\item[$UGR_{L}$] Unified Glare Rating 19
%	\item[$U_{0}$] Lighting Uniformity 0.6
%	\item[$R_{a}$] General Color Rendering Index 80
%\end{description}

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\overline{E}_{m}$ Maintained Average Illuminance of 500 lux
	\item $UGR_{L}$ Unified Glare Rating 19
	\item $U_{0}$ Lighting Uniformity 0.6
	\item $R_{a}$ General Color Rendering Index 80
\end{itemize}

The model room will meet the stated requirements if the reference plane's average illuminance will not drop below $\overline{E}_{m}$ over the course of operation of the lighting system. Calculating the initially needed illuminance values can be achieved by using the Maintenance Factor $MF$ as in~\cite{CIE97}. $MF$ defines the depreciation of the reference plane's illuminance at the end of the maintenance period. For the model room $MF$ has been chosen to be $0.75$. Reference planes, as suggested in~\cite{12464}, represent for the chosen model room's function writing desks and should therefore be placed horizontally $75$~cm above the floor. To calculate $UGR_{L}$ the task area and occupants' view directions must be known, which is beyond the scope of this project. Furthermore a room of this size using ordinary office luminaires would most probably not yield values higher than the limiting top value $UGR_{L}$. $R_{a}$ is a parameter of light sources and luminaires dependant on their light spectrum, is not dependant on the test room and will therefore not be included into calculations.
