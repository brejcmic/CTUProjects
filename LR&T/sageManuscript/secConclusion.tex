\section{Conclusion}

The presented GA was tested for several types of luminaires. It seemed to be a quite good tool for placement design and comparison optimized results dependent on luminare type. The main disadvantage of the method is long time of evaluation.

The output designs little differ for the same settings. Similar outputs are got especially for the mirror symmetry. However basic features of the design are always obvious. The luminaires are located closer together in case of prefered illuminance in comparison to prefered uniformity.

It is obvious from presented results that considering reflections has important role in the design. The reflections change the resulting illuminance and uniformity and clearly affect the placement.

The next stage of the project supposes to use the same algorithm for solution of different shapes of rooms including some room equipment. The Algorithm considering not diffused reflections is in progress too.
