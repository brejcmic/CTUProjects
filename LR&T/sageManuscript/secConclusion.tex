\section{Conclusion}

The presented GA was tested for several types of luminaires. It seems to be a quite good tool for placement design and comparison of optimized results dependent on luminare type. The main disadvantage of the method is a very long time of evaluation.

The output designs differ little for the same settings. Similar outputs have been obtained especially for mirror symmetry. However basic features of the design are always obvious. The luminaires are located closer together in case of preferred illuminance in comparison to preferred uniformity.
\newpage
Based on the presented results it is obvious, that incorporating reflections has an important role in the design. Reflections change the resulting illuminance and uniformity and clearly affect the luminaire placement.

The next stage of the project supposes to use the same algorithm for the solution of different shapes of rooms including some room equipment. The Algorithm using non-diffuse reflections is in progress too.
