\section{Genetic Algorithm Introduction}
The genetic algorithms (GA) are the part of the evolutionary computing. Similar to the living organism are the solutions represented by their genotype, that represents the genetic coding and by phenotype, that represents behavior, response and features of the solutions. Each solution is considered according to its phenotype.
