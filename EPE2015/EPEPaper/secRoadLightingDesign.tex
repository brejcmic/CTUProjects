\section{Road Lighting Design}
Lighting system designs of public roads in the Czech Republic have to meet among others the Czech Technical Standard \v{C}SN EN 13201-2 (Road lighting - Part 2: Performance requirements). For this project a road for mainly cyclists but also for pedestrians has been chosen, that is according to ČSN EN 13201-1 (Road lighting - Part 1: Selection of lighting classes) lighting situation C1 and lighting class S4. Road lighting conforming to this class must meet in terms of ČSN EN 13201-2 the requirement of maintained average horizontal illuminance $\overline{E}\geq 5$, minimum maintained illuminance $E_{min}\geq 1$ and to provide for uniformity the actual $\overline{E}$
