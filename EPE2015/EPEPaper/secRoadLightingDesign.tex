\section{Road Lighting Design}
Lighting system designs of public roads in the Czech Republic have to meet among others the Czech Technical Standard \v{C}SN EN 13201-2 (Road lighting - Part 2: Performance requirements). For this project a road for mainly cyclists but also for pedestrians has been chosen, that is according to \v{C}SN EN 13201-1 (Road lighting - Part 1: Selection of lighting classes) lighting situation C1 and lighting class S4. Road lighting conforming to this class must meet in terms of \v{C}SN EN 13201-2 the requirement of maintained average horizontal illuminance $\overline{E}\geq 5$, minimum maintained illuminance $E_{min}\geq 1$ and uniformity so that the actual $\overline{E}$ must not exceed 1.5 times the minimum $\overline{E}$ for the given lighting class.

The maintenance factor $MF$ is another entry that has to be taken into account. This factor defines the depreciation of the design level, in this case, the depreciation of illuminance $\overline{E}$ and $E_{min}$ over the course of operation of the road lighting. After choosing the luminaire Atos from Schr\'{e}der as the luminaire to be used throughout this project, the maintenance factor can be calculated from \v{C}SN EN 13201-2 ZM\v{E}NA Z1:
\begin{equation}
MF=LLMF \times LMF
