\section{Genetic Algorithm}
\subsection{Description of the solution}
The genetic algorithms are currently well known so only the introduction of the presented solution is further done. Authors chose four parameters to be identified by the algorithm:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $D_X$... the distance between the pillars.
	\item $D_Y$... overlap of the lamp from the pillar axis. The positive values were considered in the direction getting closer to the sidewalk.
	\item $Z$... the pillar high.
	\item $\alpha$... the lamp tilt.
\end{itemize}

The DNA string was made in the order of appearance of each value. The same value limits were chosen for each tested lamp:

\begin{equation}
D_X \in \left\langle 0.5 \text{ m}, 50 \text{ m}\right\rangle
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
D_Y \in \left\langle -1 \text{ m}, 1 \text{ m}\right\rangle
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Z \in \left\langle 2 \text{ m}, 15 \text{ m}\right\rangle
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\alpha \in \left\langle 0^\circ, 20^\circ \right\rangle
\end{equation}

The algorithm evaluated the illuminance at the sidewalk of length 200~m and width 3~m. The control area was set in the middle of the sidewalk of the length 80~m.
