\section{Genetic Algorithm}
\subsection{Description of the solution}
The genetic algorithms are currently well known so only the introduction of the presented solution is further done. Authors chose four parameters to be identified by the algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $D_X$... the distance between the pillars.
	\item $D_Y$... overlap of the lamp from the pillar axis. The positive values were considered in the direction getting closer to the sidewalk.
	\item $Z$... the pillar high.
	\item $\alpha$... the lamp tilt.
\end{enumerate}
