Designing interior lighting systems for indoor working places from a photometric point of view requires fulfilling two contradictory criteria, i.e. providing enough light for persons occupying the given room at a reasonable power consumption. These and more parameters have been taken into account while composing standards such as \cite{12464}, being mandatory on the territory of the Czech Republic.

For this project an administrative model room has been chosen of dimensions $5 \times 10 $~meters, $4$~meters high with luminaires $3.5$~metres above the floor. The model room's purpose has been chosen to be handwriting, writing on typewriters, reading and processing data according to reference number 5.26.2 in~\cite{12464}. For this kind of room there are several conditions that have to be met by the lighting system:

\begin{description}
	\item[$\overline{E}_{m}$] Maintained Average Illuminance of 500 lux
	\item[$UGR_{L}$] Unified Glare Rating 19
	\item[$U_{0}$] Lighting Uniformity 0.6
	\item[$R_{a}$] General Color Rendering Index 80
\end{description}

To meet the requirements set by \cite{12464} for the model room, reference plane's average illuminance must be $\overline{E}_{m}$ or greater at all times over the course of operation. To calculate the initially needed illuminance values, the Maintenance Factor has to be calculated~\cite{CIE97}. For this instance, MF has been chosen to be~$0.75$. The reference plane is defined as a horizontal plane $75$~cm above the floor for generic office tables as suggested in~\cite{12464}. $UGR_{L}$ will not be included in calculations of this project, for the task area and view directions of users are unknown. $R_{a}$ is a parameter of light sources and luminaires and thus must not be incorporated into calculations.
